## Types of keys

Keys on a keyboard are classified as follows:

~~~
naming			represents			numlock-sensitive		left-right distinction
--------------	-----------------	--------------------	-----------------------
key				functional keys	yes						no
vkey				virtual keys		yes						yes
pkey				physical keys		no							yes
~~~

Functional keys are useful for creating shortcuts, while physical keys are useful for games.
Virtual keys are not generally useful, except when you need to distinguish
between left/right key variations or between numapd keys and standalone cursor keys,
but you also need to respect the numlock key.

## Full list

Here's the full list of functional keys and their corresponding virtual keys.
You get physical keys instead of virtual keys if you set the `ignore_numlock` option,
in which case the keyboard API will act as if numlock is always on.

## Crossing cultures

Windows keyboards can be used on OSX and Mac keyboards can be used on Windows.
Each OS will try to simulate its own keyboard on the foreign keyboard.
For example, the numlock key on the Windows keyboard is mapped to numclear in OSX,
because that's where the typical Mac user expects numclear to be, regardless
of what is written on the key cap.

Here's how the mappings go:


### Windows Keyboard on OSX

win keyboard		key on OSX
----------------------------------
lwin					lcommand
rwin					rcommand

printscreen			F13

### Mac Keyboard on Windows

If you have a mac keyboard and a windows box, please fill these up.
