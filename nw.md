## Example

~~~{.lua}
local nw = require'nw'

local app = nw:app()        --get the app singleton

local win = app:window{     --create a new window
	w = 400, h = 200,        --specify window's frame size
	title = 'hello',         --specify window's title
	visible = false,         --don't show it yet
}

function win:click(button, count) --this is one way to bind events
	if button == 'left' and count == 3 then --triple click
		app:quit()
	end
end

--this is another way to bind events which allows setting multiple
--handlers for the same event type.
function win:on('keydown', function(key)
	if key == 'F11' then
		self:fullscreen(not self:fullscreen()) --toggle fullscreen state
	end
end)

function win:repaint()        --called when window needs repainting
	local bmp = win:bitmap()   --get the window's bitmap
	local cr = bitmap:cairo()  --get a cairo drawing context
	cr:set_source_rgb(0, 1, 0) --make it green
	cr:paint()
end

win:show() --show it now that it was properly set up

app:run()  --start the event loop

## Backends

API        Library     Min. platform           Most tested platform
---------- ----------- ----------------------- ------------------------
WinAPI     [winapi]    Windows XP/2000+        Windows 7 x64
Cocoa      [objc]      OSX 10.7+               OSX 10.9
Xlib       [xlib]      Ubuntu/Unity 10.04+     Ubuntu/Unity 10.04 x64

## The app object

The global app object is the API from which everything else gets created.

### `nw:app() -> app`

Get the global application object.

This calls `nw:init()` which initializes the library with the default
backend for the current platform.

## The app loop

### `app:run()`

Run the loop.

Calling run() when the loop is already running does nothing.

### `app:stop()`

Stop the loop.

Calling stop() when the loop is not running does nothing.

### `app:running() -> t|f`

Check if the loop is running.

### `app:poll() -> t|f`

Process the next pending event from the event queue.
Return true if there was an event to process, false if there wasn't.

## Quitting

### `app:quit()`

Quit the app, i.e. close all windows and stop the loop.

Quitting is a multi-phase process:

1. the `app:quitting()` event is fired. If it returns false, quitting is aborted.
2. the `win:closing()` event is fired on all non-parented windows.
   If any of them returns false, quitting is aborted.
3. `win:close(true)` is called on all windows (in reverse-creation order).
   If new windows are created during this process, quitting is aborted.
4. the app loop is stopped.

Calling `quit()` when the loop is not running or while quitting
is in progress does nothing.

### `app:autoquit(t|f)` <br> `app:autoquit() -> t|f`

Get/set the app autoquit flag (default: true).
When this flag is true, the app quits when the last window is closed.

### `app:quitting() -> [false]`

Event: the app wants to quit, but nothing was done to that effect.
Return false from this event to cancel the process.

### `win:autoquit(t|f)` <br> `win:autoquit() -> t|f`

Get/set the window autoquit flag (default: false).
When this flag is true, the app quits when the window is closed.
This flag can be used on the app's main window if there is such a thing.

## Timers

### `app:runevery(seconds, func)`

Run a function on a recurrent timer.
The timer can be stopped by returning false from the function.

### `app:runafter(seconds, func)`

Run a function on a timer once.

### `app:run(func)`

Run a function on a zero-second timer, once, inside a coroutine.
This allows calling `app:sleep()` inside the function (see below).

If the loop is not already started, it is started and then stopped after
the function finishes.

### `app:sleep(seconds)`

Sleep without blocking from inside a function that was run via app:run().
While the function is sleeping, other timers and events continue
to be processed.

This is poor man's multi-threading based on timers and coroutines.
It can be used to create complex temporal sequences withoug having to chain
timer callbacks.

Calling sleep() outside an app:run() function raises an error.

## Window tracking

### `app:windows() -> {win1, ...}`

Get all windows in creation order.

### `app:window_count([filter]) -> n`

Get the number of windows (dead or alive) without wasting a table.
`filter` can be 'root' which returns the number of non-dead
non-parented windows.

### `app:window_created(win)`

Event: a window was created.
Fired right after `win:was_created()` event is fired.

### `app:window_closed(win)`

Event: a window was closed.
Fired right after `win:was_closed()` event is fired.

## Creating windows

### `app:window(t) -> win`

Create a window (fields of _`t`_ below):

* __position__
	* `x`, `y`		 				- frame position
	* `w`, `h`						- frame size
	* `cx`, `cy`					- client area position
	* `cw`, `ch`					- client area size
	* `min_cw`, `min_ch`			- min client rect size
	* `max_cw`, `max_ch`			- max client rect size
* __state__
	* `visible`						- start visible (true)
	* `minimized`					- start minimized (false)
	* `maximized`					- start maximized (false)
	* `enabled`						- start enabled (true)
* __frame__
   * `frame`                  - frame type: 'normal', 'none', 'toolbox' ('normal')
	* `title` 						- title ('')
	* `transparent`				- transparent window (false)
* __behavior__
	* `parent`						- parent window
	* `sticky`						- moves with parent (false)
	* `topmost`						- stays on top of other windows (false)
	* `minimizable`				- allow minimization (true)
	* `maximizable`				- allow maximization (true)
	* `closeable`					- allow closing (true)
	* `resizeable`					- allow resizing (true)
	* `fullscreenable`			- allow fullscreen mode (true)
	* `activable`					- allow activation (true); only for 'toolbox' frame
	* `autoquit`					- quit the app on closing (false)
	* `edgesnapping`				- magnetized edges ('screen')
* __menu__
	* `menu`							- the menu bar

### Initial size and position

You can pass any combination of `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `cx`, `cy`, `cw`, `ch`
as long as you pass the width and the height in one way or another.
The position is optional and it defaults to OS-driven cascading.

### The window state

The window state is the combination of multiple flags (`minimized`,
`maximized`, `fullscreen`, `visible`, `active`) plus its position
and size in normal state (the `normal_frame_rect`).

State flags are independent of each other, so they can be in almost
any combination at the same time. For example, a window which starts
with `{visible = false, minimized = true, maximized = true}`
is initially hidden. If later made visible with `win:show()`,
it will show minimized. If the user then unminimizes it, it will restore
to maximized state. If the user unmaximizes it, it will restore to its
initial position and size.

### Coordinate systems

  * window-relative positions are relative to the top-left corner of the window's client area.
  * screen-relative positions are relative to the top-left corner of the main screen.

## Child windows

Child windows (`parent = win`) are top-level windows that stay on top
of their parent, minimize along with their parent, and don't appear
in the taskbar.

The following defaults are different for child windows:

  * `minimizable`: false
  * `maximizable`: false
  * `fullscreenable`: false
  * `edgesnapping`: 'parent siblings screen'
  * `sticky`: true

Child windows can't be minimizable because they don't appear in the taskbar
(they minimize when their parent is minimized).

### `win:parent() -> win|nil`

Get the window's parent (read-only).

### `win:children() -> {win1, ...}`

Get the window's children (those whose parent() is this window).

### Sticky windows

Sticky windows (`sticky = true`) follow their parent when their parent is moved.

__NOTE:__ Sticky windows [don't work](https://github.com/luapower/nw/issues/27) on Linux.

### `win:sticky() -> t|f`

Get the sticky flag (read-only).

### Toolbox windows

Toolbox windows (`frame = 'toolbox'`) show a thin title bar on Windows
(they show a normal frame on OSX and Linux).
They must be parented. They can be non-activable (`activable = false`).

## Transparent windows

Transparent windows (`transparent = true`) allow using the full alpha channel
when drawing on them. They also come with some limitations (mostly from Windows):

  * they can't be framed so you must pass `frame = 'none'`.
  * they can't have views.
  * you can't draw on them using OpenGL.

### `win:transparent() -> t|f`

Get the transparent flag (read-only).

## Window closing

Closing the window destroys it by default.
You can prevent that by returning false in the `win:closing()` event:

~~~{.lua}
function win:closing()
	self:hide()
	return false --prevent destruction
end
~~~

### `win:close([force])`

Close the window and destroy it. Children are closed first.
The `force` arg allows closing the window without firing
the `win:closing()` event.

Calling `close()` on a closed window does nothing.
Calling any other method raises an error.

### `win:dead() -> t|f`

Check if the window was destroyed.

### `win:closing()`

Event: The window is about to close.
Return false from the event handler to refuse.

### `win:was_closed()`

Event: The window was closed.
Fired after all children are closed, but before the window itself
is destroyed (`win:dead()` still returns false at this point).

### `win:closeable() -> t|f`

Get the closeable flag (read-only).

## App activation

### `app:active() -> t|f`

Check if the app is active.

### `app:activate([mode])`

Activate the app, which activates the last window that was active
before the app got deactivated.

The _mode_ arg can be:

  * 'alert' (default; Windows and OSX only; on Linux it does nothing)
  * 'force' (OSX and Linux only; on Windows it's the same as 'alert')
  * 'info'  (OSX only; on Windows it's the same as 'alert'; on Linux it does nothing)

The 'alert' mode: on Windows, this flashes the window on the taskbar until
the user activates the window. On OSX it bounces the dock icon until the
user activates the app. On Linux it does nothing.

The 'force' mode: on Windows this is the same as the 'alert' mode.
On OSX and Linux it pops up the window in the user's face
(very rude, don't do it).

The 'info' mode: this special mode allows bouncing up the dock icon
on OSX only once. On other platforms it's the same as the default 'alert' mode.

### `app:was_activated()` <br> `app:was_deactivated()`

Event: the app was activated/deactivated.

## Window activation

### `app:active_window() -> win`

Get the active window, if any.

When the app is inactive, this always returns nil.

### `win:active() -> t|f`

Check if the window is active.

When the app is inactive, this returns false for all windows.

### `win:activate()`

Activate the window. If the app is inactive, this does not activate the app.
Instead it only marks the window to be activated when the app becomes active.
If you want to alert the user that it should pay attention to the window,
call `app:activate()` after calling this function.

### `win:was_activated()` <br> `win:was_deactivated()`

Event: window was activated/deactivated.

### `win:activable() -> t|f`

Get the activable flag (read-only).

Only toolbox windows can be made non-activable. This is useful for toolboxes
that can be clicked inside without stealing keyboard focus away from the main window.

__NOTE:__ This [doesn't work](https://github.com/luapower/nw/issues/26) in Linux.

## App visibility (OSX)

### `app:hidden() -> t|f` <br> `app:hidden(t|f)` <br> `app:hide()` <br> `app:unhide()`

Get/set app visibility.

### `app:was_hidden()` <br> `app:was_unhidden()`

Event: app was hidden/unhidden.

## Window visibility

### `win:show()`

Show the window in its previous state (which can include any combination
of minimized, maximized, and fullscreen state flags).

When a hidden window is shown it is also activated, except if it was
previously minimized, in which case it is shown in minimized state
without being activated.

Calling show() on a visible (which includes minimized) window does nothing.

### `win:hide()`

Hide the window from the screen and from the taskbar, preserving its full state.

Calling hide() on a hidden window does nothing.

### `win:visible() -> t|f`

Check if a window is visible (note: that includes minimized).

### `win:visible(t|f)`

Call `show()` or `hide()` to change the window's visibility.

### `win:was_shown()` <br> `win:was_hidden()`

Event: window was shown/hidden.

## Minimization

### `win:minimizable() -> t|f`

Get the minimizable flag (read-only).

### `win:minimized() -> t|f`

Get the minimized state. This flag remains true when a minimized window is hidden.

### `win:minimize()`

Minimize the window and deactivate it. If the window is hidden,
it is shown in minimized state (and the taskbar button is not activated).

### `win:was_minimized()` <br> `win:was_unminimized()`

Event: window was minimized/unminimized.

## Maximization

### `win:maximizable() -> t|f`

Get the maximizable flag (read-only).

### `win:maximized() -> t|f`

Get the maximized state. This flag stays true if a maximized window
is minimized, hidden or enters fullscreen mode.

### `win:maximize()`

Maximize the window and activate it. If the window was hidden,
it is shown in maximized state and activated.

If the window is already maximized it is not activated.

### `win:was_maximized()` <br> `win:was_unmaximized()`

Event: window was maximized/unmaximized.

## Fullscreen mode

### `win:fullscreenable() -> t|f`

Check if a window is allowed to go in fullscreen mode (read-only).
This flag only affects OSX - the only platform which presents a fullscreen
button on the title bar. Fullscreen mode can always be engaged programatically.

### `win:fullscreen() -> t|f`

Get the fullscreen state.

### `win:fullscreen(t|f)`

Enter or exit fullscreen mode and activate the window. If the window is hidden
or minimized, it is shown in fullscreen mode and activated.

If the window is already in the desired mode it is not activated.

### `win:entered_fullscreen()` <br> `win:exited_fullscreen()`

Event: entered/exited fullscreen mode.

## Restoring

### `win:restore()`

Restore from minimized, maximized or fullscreen state, i.e. unminimize
if the window was minimized, exit fullscreen if it was in fullscreen mode,
or unmaximize it if it was maximized (otherwise do nothing).

The window is always activated unless it was in normal mode.

### `win:shownormal()`

Show the window in normal state.

The window is always activated even when it's already in normal mode.

## State tracking

State tracking is about getting and tracking the entire user-changeable
state of a window (of or the app) as a whole.

### `win:state() -> state`

Get the window's full state string, eg. 'visible maximized active'.

### `win:changed(old_state, new_state)`

Event: window state has changed.

### `app:state() -> state`

Get the app's full state string, eg. 'visible active'.

### `app:changed(old_state, new_state)`

Event: app state has changed.

## Enabled state

### `win:enabled(t|f)` <br> `win:enabled() -> t|f`

Get/set the enabled flag (default: true). A disabled window cannot receive
mouse or keyboard focus. Disabled windows are useful for implementing
modal windows: make a child window and disable the parent while showing
the child, and enable back the parent when closing the child.

__NOTE:__ This [doesn't work](https://github.com/luapower/nw/issues/25) on Linux.

## Client/screen conversion

### `win:to_screen(x, y) -> x, y`

Convert a point from the window's client space to screen space.

### `win:to_client(x, y) -> x, y`

Convert a point from screen space to the window's client space.

## Frame/client conversion

### `app:client_to_frame(frame, has_menu, x, y, w, h) -> x, y, w, h`

Given a client rectangle, return the frame rectangle for a certain
frame type. If `has_menu` is true, then the window also has a menu.

### `app:frame_to_client(frame, has_menu, x, y, w, h) -> x, y, w, h`

Given a frame rectangle, return the client rectangle for a certain
frame type. If `has_menu` is true, then the window also has a menu.

### `app:frame_extents(frame, has_menu) -> left, top, right, bottom`

Get the frame extents for a certain frame type.

## Size and position

### `win:frame_rect() -> x, y, w, h`

Get the frame rect in current state (in screen coordinates).

### `win:frame_rect(x, y, w, h)`

Set the frame rect (and change state to normal).

### `win:normal_frame_rect() -> x, y, w, h`

Get the frame rect in normal state (in screen coordinates).

### `win:client_rect() -> cx, cy, cw, ch`

Get the client rect in current state (in screen coordinates).

### `win:client_rect(cx, cy, cw, ch)`

Move/resize the window to accomodate a specified client area position and size.

### `win:client_size() -> cw, ch`

Get the size of the window's client area.

### `win:client_size(cw, ch)`

Resize the window to accomodate a specified client area size.

### `win:sizing(when, how, x, y, w, h)`

Event: window size/position is about to change.
Return a new rectangle (x, y, w, h) to affect the window's final size and position.

__NOTE:__ This does not fire in Linux.

### `win:was_moved(cx, cy)`

Event: window was moved.

### `win:was_resized(cw, ch)`

Event: window was resized.

## Size constraints

### `win:resizeable() -> t|f`

Get the resizeable flag.

### `win:minsize() -> cw, ch`

Get the minimum client rect size.

### `win:minsize(cw, ch)`

Set the minimum client rect size.

The window is resized if it was smaller than this size.

### `win:maxsize() -> cw, ch`

Get the maximum client rect size.

### `win:maxsize(cw, ch)`

Set the maximum client rect size.

The window is resized if it was larger than this size.

This constraint applies to the maximized state too.

## Edge snapping

### `win:edgesnapping() -> mode` <br> `win:edgesnapping(mode)`

Get/set edge snapping mode, which is a string containing any combination
of the following words separated by spaces:

  * 'app' - snap to app's windows
  * 'other' - snap to other windows
  * 'screen' - snap to screen edges
  * 'all' - equivalent to 'app other screen'

__NOTE:__ Edge snapping doesn't work on Linux because the `win:sizing()`
event doesn't fire there. It is however already (poorly) implemented
by some window managers (eg. Unity) so all is not lost.

### `win:magnets(which) -> {r1, ...}`

Event: get edge snapping rectangles (rectangles are tables with fields _x, y, w, h_).

## Z-Order

### `win:topmost() -> t|f` <br> `win:topmost(t|f)`

Get/set the topmost flag. A topmost window stays on top of all other non-topmost windows.

### `win:raise([rel_to_win])`

Raise above all windows/specific window.

### `win:lower([rel_to_win])`

Lower below all windows/specific window.

## Window title

### `win:title() -> title` <br> `win:title(title)`

Get/set the window's title.

## Displays

In non-mirrored multi-monitor setups, the displays are mapped
on a virtual surface, with the main display's top-left corner at (0, 0).

### `app:displays() -> {disp1, ...}`

Get displays (in no specific order). Mirror displays are not included.

### `app:display_count() -> n`

Get the display count without enumerating them.

Get the display's desktop rectangle (screen minus any taskbars).

### `app:displays_changed()`

Event: displays changed.

### `win:display() -> disp`

Get the display the window is currently on.

## Cursors

### `win:cursor() -> name, t|f` <br> `win:cursor(name|t|f)`

Get/set the mouse cursor and/or visibility. The name can be:

  * 'arrow' (default)
  * 'text'
  * 'hand'
  * 'cross'
  * 'forbidden'
  * 'size_diag1' (i.e. NE-SW)
  * 'size_diag2' (i.e. NW-SE)
  * 'size_h'
  * 'size_v'
  * 'move'
  * 'busy_arrow'

## Keyboard

See [nw_keyboard] for the list of key names.

### `app:key(query) -> t|f`

Get key pressed and toggle states. The query can be one or more
key names separated by spaces or by `+` eg. 'alt+f3' or 'alt f3'.
The key name can start with `^` in which case the toggle state of that key
is queried instead eg. '^capslock' returns the toggle state of the
caps lock key while 'capslock' returns its pressed state.
(only the capslock, numlock and scrolllock keys have toggle states).

### `win:keydown(key)`

Event: a key was pressed (not sent on repeat).

### `win:keyup(key)`

Event: a key was depressed.

### `win:keypress(key)`

Event: sent after keydown and on key repeat.

### `win:keychar(s)`

Event: sent after keypress for displayable characters; _`s`_ is a utf-8
string and can contain one or more code points.

## Hi-DPI support

By default, windows contents are scaled by the OS on Hi-DPI screens,
so they look blurry but they are readable even if the app is unaware
that it is showing on a dense screen. Making the app Hi-DPI-aware means
telling the OS to disable this automatic raster scaling and allow the
app to scale the UI itself (but this time in vector space) in order
to make it readable again on a dense screen.

### `app:autoscaling() -> t|f`

Check if autoscaling is enabled.

### `app:autoscaling(t|f)`

Enable/disable autoscaling.

__NOTE:__ This function must be called before the OS stretcher kicks in,
i.e. before creating any windows or calling any display APIs.
It will silently fail otherwise.

### `disp.scalingfactor`

Get the display's scaling factor. This is 1 when autoscaling is enabled.

If autoscaling is disabled, windows must check their display's
scaling factor and scale the UI accordingly.

### `win:scalingfactor_changed()`

A window's display scaling factor changed or most likely the window
was moved to a screen with a different scaling factor.

## Views

Views allow partitioning a window's client area into multiple non-overlapping
rectangle-shaped regions that can be rendered using different technologies.
In particular, you can use OpenGL on some regions, while using bitmaps
(and thus cairo) on others. This gives a simple path for drawing
an antialiased 2D UI around a 3D scene as an alternative to drawing
on the textures of orto-projected quads. Mouse events work the same
on views as they do on windows (note: the window doesn't receive
mouse events while the mouse is over a view).

### `win:views() -> {view1, ...}`

Get the window's views.

### `win:view_count() -> n`

Get the number of views without wasting a table.

### `win:view(t) -> view`

Create a view (fields of _`t`_ below):

* `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`	- view's position (in window's client space) and size
* `visible`				- start visible (default: true)
* `anchors`				- resizing anchors (default: 'lt'); can be 'ltrb'

### `view:free()`

Destroy the view.

### `view:dead() -> t|f`

Check if the view was destroyed.

### `view:visible() -> t|f` <br> `view:visible(t|f)` <br> `view:show()` <br> `view:hide()`

Get/set the view's visibility.

The position and size of the view are preserved while hidden (anchors keep working).

### `view:rect() -> x, y, w, h` <br> `view:rect(x, y, w, h)`

Get/set the view's position (in window's client space) and size.

The view rect is valid and can be changed while the view is hidden.

### `view:size() -> w, h` <br> `view:size(w, h)`

Get/set the view's size.

### `view:anchors() -> anchors` <br> `view:anchors(anchors)`

Get/set the anchors: they can be any combination of 'ltrb' characters
representing left, top, right and bottom anchors respectively.

Anchors are a simple but very effective way of doing stitched layouting.
This is how they work: there's four possible anchors which you can set,
one for each side of the view. Setting an anchor on one side fixates
the distance between that side and the same side of the window
the view is on, so that when the window is moved/resized, the view
is also moved/resized in order to preserve the initial distance
to that side of the window.

### `view:rect_changed(x, y, w, h)` <br> `view:was_moved(x, y)` <br> `view:was_resized(w, h)`

Event: view's size and/or position changed.

## Mouse

### `win/view:mouse() -> t`

Get the mouse state, which is a table with fields:
_x, y, inside, left, right, middle, ex1, ex2_

The mouse state is not queried: it is the state at the time of the last mouse event.

### `win/view:mouseenter()` <br> `win/view:mouseleave()`

Event: mouse entered/left the client area of the window.

These events do not fire while the mouse is captured (see mousedown)
but a mouseleave event _will_ fire after mouseup _if_ mouseup happens
outside the client area of the window/view that captured the mouse.

### `win/view:mousemove(x, y)`

Event: the mouse was moved.

### `win/view:mousedown(button, x, y)`

Event: a mouse button was pressed; button can be 'left', 'right', 'middle', 'ex1', 'ex2'.

While a mouse button is down, the mouse is _captured_ by the window/view
which received the mousedown event, which means that the same window/view
will continue to receive mousemove events even if the mouse leaves
its client area.

### `win/view:mouseup(button, x, y)`

Event: a mouse button was depressed.

### `win/view:click(button, count, x, y)`

Event: a mouse button was clicked (fires immediately after mousedown).

### Repeated clicks

#### TL;DR

~~~{.lua}
function win:click(button, count, x, y)
	if count == 2 then     --double click
		...
	elseif count == 3 then --triple click
		...
		return true         --triple click is as high as we go in this app
	end
end
~~~

#### How it works

When the user clicks the mouse repeatedly, with a small enough interval
between clicks and over the same target, a counter is incremented.
When the interval between two clicks is larger than the threshold
or the mouse is moved too far away from the initial target,
the counter is reset (i.e. the click-chain is interrupted).
Returning `true` on the `click()` event also resets the counter.

This allows processing of double-clicks, triple-clicks, or multi-clicks
by checking the `count` argument on the `click()` event. If your app
doesn't need to process double-clicks or multi-clicks, you can just ignore
the `count` argument. If it does, you must return `true` after processing
the event with the highest count so that the counter is reset.

For instance, if your app supports double-click over some target,
you must return `true` when count is 2, otherwise you might get a count of 3
on the next click sometimes, instead of 1 as expected. If your app
supports both double-click and triple-click over a target,
you must return `true` when the count is 3 to break the click chain,
but you must not return anything when the count is 2,
or you'll never get a count of 3.

The double-click time interval is from the user's mouse settings
and it is queried on every click.

### `win/view:wheel(delta, x, y)` <br> `win/view:hwheel(delta, x, y)`

Event: the mouse vertical or horizontal wheel was moved.
The delta represents the number of lines to scroll.

The number of lines per scroll notch is from the user's mouse settings
and it is queried on every wheel event (Windows, OSX).

## Rendering

Drawing on a window or view must be done inside the `repaint()` event
by requesting the window's bitmap or OpenGL context and drawing on it.
The OS fires `repaint` whenever it loses (part of) the contents
of the window. To force a repaint anytime, use `win:invalidate()`.

### `win/view:repaint()`

Event: window needs redrawing. To redraw the window, simply request
the window's bitmap or OpenGL context and draw using that.

### `win/view:invalidate()`

Request window redrawing.

### `win/view:bitmap() -> bmp`

Get a bgra8 [bitmap] object to draw on. The bitmap is freed when
the window's client area changes size, so keeping a reference to it
outside the `repaint()` event is generally not useful.

The alpha channel is not used unless this is a transparent window
(note: views cannot be transparent).

### `bmp:clear()`

Fill the bitmap with zeroes.

### `bmp:cairo() -> cr`

Get a [cairo] context on the bitmap. The context lasts as long as the bitmap lasts.

### `win/view:free_cairo(cr)`

Event: cairo context needs to be freed.

### `win/view:free_bitmap(bmp)`

Event: bitmap needs to be freed.

### `win/view:gl() -> gl`

Get an OpenGL context/API to draw on the window or view.

## Menus

Add/set a menu item. The options are:

* `action` - can be a function or another menu to be used as a submenu
* `text` - the text to display:
	* `&` before a letter creates an _access key_
	* `\t` followed by a key combination creates a _shortcut key_
	* the empty string (the default) creates a separator
	* eg. `'&Close\tAlt+F4'` shows as '<u>C</u>lose Alt+F4' and activates on `Alt+C` and on `Alt+F4`
* `submenu` - a submenu (same as when `action` is a submenu)
* `enabled` - enabled state (true)
* `checked` - checked state (false)

### `menu:remove(index)`

Remove menu item at index.

### `menu:get(index) -> item` <br> `menu:get(index, prop) -> val`

corresponds to the following mouse events:

  * 'enter' - mouse enter
  * 'hover' - mouse move
  * 'drop' - mouse button up
  * 'leave' - mouse leave

The `t` arg is a table cotaining the drag payload in one or more formats:
`{format = data}`. The `x`, `y` args are the mouse coordinates in window/view
client space.

You can respond to the 'enter' and 'hover' stages by returning:

  * 'copy' - show a cursor indicating that the data is being copied
  * 'link' - show a cursor indicating that the data is being linked
  * 'none' - show the normal arrow cursor
  * 'abort' - show the forbidden icon
  * true - means 'copy'
  * false - means 'abort'
  * nil/nothing - means 'abort'

## Events

Call `func` when `event_name` happens. Multiple functions can be attached
to the same event.

### `app/win/view:events(enabled) -> prev_state`

Enable/disable events.

### `app/win/view:event(name, args...)`

This is a meta-event fired on every other event.
The event's name and args are passed in.

## Version checks

### `app:ver(query) -> t|f`

Check that a certain backend API is at a specified version or beyond.
The query has the form `'<API> <version>'` where API can be
'Windows', 'OSX' or 'X'.

Example: `app:ver'OSX 10.8'` returns `true` on OSX 10.8 and beyond.

For Windows you can use the following table to figure it out:

Release							Version

Windows Server 2003 R2		5.2
Windows Server 2003			5.2
Windows XP 64-Bit Edition	5.2
Windows XP						5.1
Windows 2000					5.0

__NOTE:__ Apps not manifested for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10
will report platforms greater than 6.2 as 6.2 (the [luajit] package
comes with proper manifest files).

## Extending

### `nw.backends -> {os -> module_name}`

Default backend modules for each OS.

### `nw:init([backend_name])`

Init `nw` with a specific backend (can be called only once).

## Common mistakes

### Assuming that calls are blocking

The number one mistake you can make is to assume that all calls are blocking.
It's very easy to make that mistake because some of them actually are blocking
on some platforms (in order of sanity: Windows, OSX and Linux -- X11 is
particularly bad because _all_ calls are asynchronous there).
In a perfect world they would all be blocking and non-failing
which would make programming with them much more robust and intuitive.
The real world is an unspecified mess. So __never, ever mix queries
with commands__, i.e. never assume that after a state-changing function
returns you can make any assumptions about the state of the objects involved.

### Creating windows in visible state

The `visible` flag when creating windows defaults to `true`, but you should
really create windows with `visible = false`, set up all the event handlers
on them and then call `win:show()`, otherwise you will not catch any events
that trigger before you set up the event handlers (sometimes that includes
the `repaint()` event so you will be showing a non-painted window).

## Getting Involved

This is one of the bigger bricks of luapower but it is one which lends
itself well to community development. The frontend uses composition rather
than inheritance to connect to the backend so the communication between the
two is always explicit. Features are well separated functionally and visually
in the code so they can be developed separately without much risk of
regressions. The code is well commented and there's unit tests and
interactive tests which cover most of the functionality. The code follows
the luapower [coding-style] and [api-design] guidelines.

### Development process

All the development planning, coordination and communication is done via
github issues and milestones.

### Design Goals

  * level out platform differences for common functionality.
  * _do_ support platform idioms and platform-specific functionality.
  * minimize the need for emulation of missing features by rethinking the API.
  * take preventive measures to avoid platform behavior:
    * raise errors for parameter combinations that are not universally supported.
    * clamp values to universally supported ranges.
    * make stable iterators with specified order or better yet, return arrays.
  * seek orthogonality, but do add convenience methods where useful.
