## `local nw = require'nw'`

Cross-platform library for displaying and manipulating native windows,
drawing in their client area using [cairo] or [opengl], and accessing
input devices in a consistent and well-specified manner across Windows,
Linux and OS X.

## Quick Example

~~~{.lua}
local nw = require'nw'

local app = nw:app()

local win = app:window{x = 100, y = 100, w = 400, h = 200, title = 'hello'}

function win:click(button, count)
	if button == 'left' and count == 3 then --triple click
		app:quit()
	end
end

function win:keydown(key)
	if key == 'F11' then
		self:fullscreen(not self:fullscreen())
	end
end

app:run() --start the main loop

~~~

## Features

  * frameless transparent windows
  * edge snapping
  * full screen mode
  * multi-monitor support
  * complete access to the US keyboard
  * triple-click events
  * multi-touch gestures
  * unicode

## Style

  * consistent and fully-specified behavior accross all supported platforms
  * no platform-specific features except for supporting platform idioms
  * unspecified behavior is a bug
  * unsupported parameter combinations are errors
  * properties for state are orthogonal to each other
  * iterators are stable and with specified order

## Backends

  * cocoa: OSX 10.7+
  * winapi: Windows XP/2000+

## Behavior

### State variables

State variables are independent of each other, so a window can be maximized, in full screen mode and hidden
all at the same time. Changing the state to 'minimized' won't affect the fact that the window is still hidden,
nor that it is in full screen mode. If the window is shown, it will be in full screen mode. Out of full screen
mode it will be minimized. Likewise, moving or resizing the window affects the frame rectangle of the
'normal' mode. If the window is maximized, resizing it won't have an immediate effect, but changing the state
to 'normal' will show the window in its new size.

Maximizing or restoring a window while visible has the side effect of activating the window,
if it's not active already.

### Closing windows

Closing a window destroys it by default. You can prevent that by returning false on the `closing` event.

~~~{.lua}
function win:closing()
	self:hide()
	return false --prevent destruction
end
~~~

### Closing the app

The `app:run()` call returns after the last window is destroyed. Because of that, `app:quit()`
only has to close all windows, and it tries to do that in reverse-creation order.

### Multi-clicks

When the user clicks the mouse repeatedly, with a small enough interval between clicks and over the same target,
a counter is incremented. When the interval between two clicks is larger than the threshold or the mouse is moved
too far away from the initial target, the counter is reset (i.e. the click-chain is interrupted).
Returning true on the `click` event also resets the counter (i.e. interrupts the click chain).

This allows processing of double-clicks, triple-clicks, or multi-clicks by checking the `count` argument on
the `click` event. If your app doesn't need to process double-clicks or multi-clicks, you can just ignore
the `count` argument. If it does, you must return true after processing the multi-click event so that
the counter is reset.

For instance, if your app supports double-click over some target, you must return true when count is 2,
otherwise you might get a count of 3 on the next click sometimes, instead of 1 as expected. If your app
supports both double-click and triple-click over a target, you must return true when the count is 3
to break the click chain, but you must not return anything when the count is 2, or you'll never get
a count of 3.

### Corner cases

  * calling any method on a closed window results in error, except for win:free() which does nothing.
  * calling app:run() while running is a no op.
  * app:windows() can return dead windows (but not new windows).
  * calling display functions on an invalid display object results in error (monitors can come and go too you know).
